                                 About Git and Github 

Today i refer the document related to git provided by you.I have already created github account ,so then i create a new repository named "web".
In which i learn how to cloning a project in our local machine or a pc. By cloning we have all the code present in a paticular repository
directly into our pc.

Then preform various commands of git in gitbash teminal.

git remote -v : It helps us to manage connections to remote repositories and -v shows their shortname or the nickname like origin.
git fetch : It is use to fetch the contents from a remote repository.
git checkout : Allows us to temporarily reset our directory to another commit.
git checkout main : It brings back to the previous or the main state.
git add : It is used to add files in the our  current directory but not in the repository.
git status : It shows the status of our files in our directory.
git push origin: It pushes the current repo to the origin.
git diff filename: It compares th file written previously and if the changes are there in the present file the it shows the difference 
                   between them.
git merge : Merges the branches.

Apart from this commands which are not in the given document that i learned are:

git pull : pull data from a remote repo.
touch <file name> : It adds a file into the current directory.
git log : shows the detailed logs of all the commits made in the project. 
git init : It creates new  blank git repository.It is the first command on the git.
 
And also i watch some vedios related to git and github from youtube.
